# Standards & Methodology

## Purpose
This website exists to document **verifiable actions, decisions, and outcomes** of individuals and organizations exercising public power.

It is an **archive of record**, not a platform for opinion, advocacy, or speculation.

Our goal is simple:  
**show what happened, who decided, what followed — and let readers verify every fact themselves.**

---

## The Source Standard (Non-Negotiable Rule)
**Every factual statement on this site is paired with a clickable source.** No exceptions.

If a statement cannot be sourced, it is **not published as fact**.

---

## Source Hierarchy

### Primary Sources (Highest Weight)
- Court records and dockets  
- Charging documents and indictments  
- Written judicial orders  
- Official transcripts  
- Statutes, regulations, and filings  
- Jail booking and release logs  

### Secondary Sources
- Local reporting with direct sourcing  
- National reporting that cites primary records  
- Wire services  

### Opinion / Advocacy Sources
- Editorials  
- Commentary  
- Advocacy organizations  
- Partisan outlets  

Opinion sources are **never used alone** to establish facts.

---

## Claim Classification
- **Verified** — Directly supported by primary records  
- **Supported** — Consistent across reliable secondary reporting  
- **Unverified** — Claimed but lacking sufficient evidence  
- **Contradicted** — Conflicts with documented records  

Unverified or contradicted claims are **clearly labeled** and never presented as fact.

---

## Citation Format (“Bible Verse” Model)
Every factual statement ends with a **citation number**.

Clicking a citation reveals:
- Source title and publisher  
- Publication date  
- Direct link  
- Source type (Primary / Secondary / Opinion)  
- Contributor (if disclosed)  
- Date added to the archive  

Readers are encouraged to click sources and verify directly.

## Case Methodology
For disputed decisions or serious outcomes, we apply a fixed structure:
1. Timeline of events (facts only)  
2. Decision-makers identified  
3. What each side claims  
4. Evidence provided by each side  
5. Documented outcome(s)  
6. Facts Verdict  
7. Open questions  

---

## Outcomes & Consequences
When a decision leads to measurable harm, outcomes are documented **factually and directly**, without euphemism or exaggeration.

---

## Intent & Motivation
We do not assign intent, ideology, or motive unless:
- it is explicitly stated by the subject, and  
- supported by direct sourcing.

---

## Corrections Policy
If an error is identified and supported by evidence:
- content is corrected  
- a correction note is added  
- the source trail remains visible  

Corrections are logged publicly.

---

## Submissions & External Contributions
Submissions may include new sources, missing records, corrections, updates, or documented whistleblower material.

AI may assist with triage, but **human review is required before publication**.

---

## Independence & Funding
This site is independently maintained and funded through voluntary public support.

Donations do not influence coverage. Facts are not for sale.
