# Before You Enter

This website is a **public accountability archive**.

It exists to document **verifiable actions, decisions, and outcomes** of individuals in positions of public power — including prosecutors, judges, elected officials, and organizations that materially influence criminal justice outcomes.

This site does **not** exist to persuade you what to think.  
It exists to show you **what happened**, **who decided**, and **what followed** — with sources attached to every factual claim.

---

## How This Site Works

- Every factual statement includes a **clickable source**
- Primary sources are prioritized
- Disputed claims are clearly labeled
- Corrections are logged publicly
