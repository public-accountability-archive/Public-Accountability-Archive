# Before You Enter

This website is a **public accountability archive**.

It exists to document **verifiable actions, decisions, and outcomes** of individuals in positions of public power — including prosecutors, judges, elected officials, and organizations that materially influence criminal justice outcomes.

This site does **not** exist to persuade you what to think.  
It exists to show you **what happened**, **who decided**, and **what followed** — with sources attached to every factual claim.

## How This Site Works
- Every factual statement includes a **clickable source**.
- Primary sources are prioritized.
- Disputed claims are labeled.
- Corrections are logged publicly.

## Reader Responsibility
Some material may be disturbing, especially where violence or loss of life occurred.

Readers are responsible for engaging thoughtfully and verifying sources directly.

## Support This Archive
This project is sustained through independent support. Contributions help fund record access, verification, hosting, and preservation.
