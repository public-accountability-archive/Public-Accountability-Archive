# Standards & Methodology

## Purpose
This website exists to document **verifiable actions, decisions, and outcomes** of individuals and organizations exercising public power.

It is an **archive of record**, not a platform for opinion, advocacy, or speculation.

Our goal is simple:  
**show what happened, who decided, what followed — and let readers verify every fact themselves.**

---

## The Source Standard (Non-Negotiable Rule)

**Every factual statement on this site is paired with a clickable source.**  
No exceptions.

If a statement cannot be sourced, it is **not published as fact**.

This rule applies to:
- Body text
- Headings
- Timelines
- Tables
- Summaries
- Charts

---

## Source Hierarchy

All sources are ranked and labeled so readers can instantly judge evidentiary strength.

### Primary Sources (Highest Weight)
- Court records and dockets  
- Charging documents and indictments  
- Written judicial orders  
- Official transcripts  
- Statutes, regulations, and filings  
- Jail booking and release logs  

### Secondary Sources
- Local reporting with direct sourcing  
- National reporting that cites primary records  
- Wire services  

### Opinion / Advocacy Sources
- Editorials  
- Commentary  
- Advocacy organizations  
- Partisan outlets  

Opinion sources are **never used alone** to establish facts.

---

## Claim Classification

Every factual claim falls into one of the following categories:

- **Verified** — Directly supported by primary records  
- **Supported** — Consistent across reliable secondary reporting  
- **Unverified** — Claimed but lacking sufficient evidence  
- **Contradicted** — Conflicts with documented records  

Unverified or contradicted claims are **clearly labeled** and never presented as fact.

---

## Citation Format (“Bible Verse” Model)

Every factual statement ends with a **citation number**.

Example:
> Bail was reduced from $15,000 to $5,000 on December 8, 2025.[1]

Clicking a citation reveals:
- Source title and publisher  
- Publication date  
- Direct link  
- Source type (Primary / Secondary / Opinion)  
- Contributor (if disclosed)  
- Date added to the archive  

Readers are encouraged to click sources and verify directly.

---

## Case Methodology

For cases involving disputed decisions or serious outcomes, the following structure is applied:

1. Timeline of events (facts only)  
2. Decision-makers identified  
3. What each side claims  
4. Evidence provided by each side  
5. Documented outcome(s)  
6. Facts Verdict  
7. Open questions  

No case is summarized without this structure.

---

## Outcomes & Consequences

When a decision leads to measurable harm — including re-offense, injury, or loss of life — outcomes are documented **factually and directly**.

We do not:
- Use euphemisms  
- Minimize consequences  
- Attribute intent  

Only documented outcomes are recorded.

---

## Intent & Motivation

This site **does not assign intent, ideology, or motive** unless:
- It is explicitly stated by the subject **and**
- It is supported by direct sourcing  

Absence of evidence is treated as absence — not filled with assumption.

---

## Corrections Policy

Accuracy is a process, not a claim.

If an error is identified and supported by evidence:
- The content is corrected  
- A correction note is added  
- The original source trail remains visible  

Corrections are logged publicly.

---

## Submissions & External Contributions

This site accepts submissions including:
- New sources  
- Missing records  
- Corrections  
- Case updates  
- Whistleblower material with documentation  

AI tools may assist with triage and verification, but **human review is required before publication**.

---

## Independence & Funding

This site is independently maintained and funded through voluntary public support.

Donations:
- Do not influence coverage  
- Do not affect inclusion or exclusion  
- Do not alter conclusions  

Facts are not for sale.

---

## Commitment

Every page on this site follows these standards.

If a claim does not meet them, it does not belong here.
