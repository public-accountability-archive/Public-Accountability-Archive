# Before You Enter

This website is a **public accountability archive**.

It exists to document **verifiable actions, decisions, and outcomes** of individuals and organizations exercising public power — including prosecutors, judges, elected officials, and institutions that materially influence public safety and justice outcomes.

This site does **not** exist to tell you what to think.  
It exists to show you **what happened**, **who decided**, and **what followed** — with sources attached to every factual statement.
