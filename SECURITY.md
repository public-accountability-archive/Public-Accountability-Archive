# Security Policy

## Purpose

The Public Accountability Archive exists to preserve factual integrity, source traceability, and public trust.  
This repository is intentionally structured to prevent unauthorized, silent, or unverified modifications.

Security is treated as a first-class requirement, not an afterthought.

---

## Content Integrity Model

- All published content is source-based and verifiable.
- No content may be altered without an auditable change record.
- Direct, unreviewed edits to protected branches are prohibited.
- Historical accuracy takes precedence over narrative framing.

Corrections are logged — not erased.

---

## Edit & Change Controls

- The `main` branch is protected.
- All changes require a pull request.
- All pull requests require review and approval.
- Conversations must be resolved before merging.
- Force pushes and branch deletions are disabled.
- Bypass permissions are not granted.

This prevents:
- Silent edits
- Post-hoc narrative manipulation
- Unauthorized content changes

---

## Submission Boundary

This project does **not** allow direct public editing of live content.

Future submission mechanisms (if enabled) will:
- Be read-only by default
- Require independent verification
- Be reviewed before publication
- Preserve original submissions even if rejected

---

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a vulnerability that could:
- Alter content without authorization
- Expose unpublished material
- Compromise audit integrity

Report it responsibly via:
- GitHub Issues (if appropriate), or
- Direct contact as listed in future disclosures

Do **not** publicly disclose vulnerabilities before review.

---

## Transparency Commitment

Security measures are designed to:
- Protect facts, not opinions
- Preserve history, not rewrite it
- Maintain public confidence through restraint and traceability

This archive favors correctness over speed and verification over virality.
